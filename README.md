# Deep learning (HITSZ)

Cl√©ment Gorin, clement.gorin@univ-paris1.fr

## Overview

Many important questions in economics remain unanswered, partly because the data necessary to address them is encoded into high-dimensional data structures such as images or text. Applied economists have become increasingly interested in using deep learning models to transform these data into simpler representations, which can be used as inputs for subsequent economic analysis. After introducing predictive modelling, this course provides a comprehensive understanding of neural network models, as well as some of the most capable structures to process image and language data. While grounded in theory and mathematical formalisation, the course emphasizes intuitive understanding and practical implementation using Python.

## Outline

The course is organised in three three-hours sessions. Each session articulates a theoretical lecture and an optional practical application using Python.

1. **Neural networks**  
   _Lecture_: Predictive modelling, Regularisation, Neural networks, Backpropagation  
   _Application_: Simple example using TensorFlow

2. **Image modelling**  
   _Lecture_: Image data, Image processing, Convolutional networks, Representations  
   _Application_: Image classification or Image segmentation or Image localisation

3. **Language modelling**  
   _Lecture_: Text data, Embeddings networks, Recurrent networks, Transformers  
   _Application_: Sentiment analysis

## Resources

Running the practical applications requires a computer with administrator rights and a working internet connection. For practical exercises, we use the [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) format. To execute notebooks, you can use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or equivalent) remote environment. Alternatively, you can install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution of Python 3.12 or above, with a development environment that supports notebooks such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
